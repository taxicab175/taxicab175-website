        <p>
          Julian is a junior at UC Irvine pursuing his Bachelors in Data
          Science. During his time in college, he has focused his studies and
          activities in statistical analysis and computer science techniques. He
          has developed an interest in the intersection between data analysis,
          sustainability and transportation. In his free time, you can find him
          playing trumpet with jazz combos and big bands or in the weight room
          at the gym. Find out more about him at his

        <p>
          Carleton is a 3<sup>rd</sup> year computer science major. He has an
          interest in machine learning as well as its application to robotics.
          While in High school he competed for 3 years on an FRC robotics team.
          Now in college he enjoys building his own robotics systems, which he
          plans to use to learn more about reinforcement learning and computer
          vision. Find out more about him at his
