## Goals
Our first goal is to use one of the methods described above (deep q network, imitation learning, an ensamble of deep q networks) in order to get a duckie bot to complete the "lane following" (LF) challenge. Our second goal is to implement the other two methods and compare how well all three methods do on the LF challenge. Our third goal is to is to use the best method to complete the "lane following with dynamic vehicles" (LFV) challenge and "lane following with dynamic vehicles and intersections" (LFVI) challenge.
